# Fedora Setup Script - Alpha, WIP
This is a post-install script to help me set up Fedora installs how I like them as quickly as possible. I may add interactivity and flexibility later.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/starship-boi/fedora-setup && cd fedora-setup
```
2. Make scripts executable and run `main.sh` (requires sudo):
```
chmod +x main.sh root.sh user.sh && ./main.sh
```

### Single command:
```
sudo echo && git clone https://github.com/starship-boi/fedora-setup && cd fedora-setup && chmod +x main.sh root.sh user.sh && ./main.sh
```
